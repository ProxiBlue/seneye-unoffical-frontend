# seneye-unoffical-frontend

This is an alternative frontend to the seneye provided frontend. This is handy as you can actually refresh it just by reloading, something you can't easily do with the mobile app they provide.

This software is in a hideous unfinished state. Use at your own risk. It just about did the job for me, so I'm happy with it.
